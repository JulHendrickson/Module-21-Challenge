# Module-21-Challenge

For this challenge I've defined a new cryptocurrency named KaseiCoin. It's a fungible token thatâ€™s ERC-20 compliant. I also created a crowdsale contract to launch the new token.

## Files

Starter_Code contains all the code for this challenge.
Images is a folder holding screenshots used in the Evaluation Evidence section later in this README.
KaseiCoin.sol is the solidity file containing the KaseiCoin token contract.
KaseiCoinCrowdsale.sol is the solidity file containing the crowdsale contract and the crowdsale deployer contract.
